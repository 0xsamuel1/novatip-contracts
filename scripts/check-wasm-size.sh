# and `make ci` call this script instead of carrying their own copy.
# Override with MAX_WASM_BYTES=... in the environment if needed.

# Usage: ./scripts/check-wasm-size.sh [path/to/tip_splitter.wasm]

# Hard ceiling for the artifact `stellar contract build` produces — the same
# wasm the deploy script ships (#131). Optimized builds land near ~15 KiB, so
# 24 KiB leaves ~1.5x headroom for ordinary feature work; a real regression
# (heavyweight dep, profile misconfig) still trips it.
#
# Raising it is fine when the growth is understood and intentional — the point
# is that the bump shows up in a diff and gets a reason.
