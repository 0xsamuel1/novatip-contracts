# Set or clear a tip jar's minimum tip amount.
#
# Required env (see .env.example):
#   NETWORK      testnet | mainnet | local
#   SOURCE       Stellar CLI identity used to sign (must be the jar owner)
#   SLUG         the jar's public id, e.g. @alice
#   MIN_TIP      positive integer amount in the token's smallest unit (USDC:
#                1_000_000 == 1 USDC). Unset, empty, or "none" clears the
#                minimum so any positive tip is accepted again.
#   CONTRACT_ID  optional; defaults to .contract-id.<NETWORK>
#
# Usage:  set -a; source .env; set +a; ./scripts/set-min-tip.sh
#         MIN_TIP=5000000 ./scripts/set-min-tip.sh   # 5 USDC floor
#         MIN_TIP=none   ./scripts/set-min-tip.sh   # clear the floor
#
# Passing "no minimum" to the CLI
# ------------------------------
# `set_min_tip_amount(jar_id, min_amount: Option<i128>)` takes an optional
# argument, and the Stellar CLI derives that from the contract spec: an
# `Option<T>` parameter becomes an *omittable* flag. Omitting `--min_amount`
# entirely is what sends `None`; it is not the same as passing an empty value,
# and there is no `--min_amount none`-style spelling to reach. So clearing a
# minimum means invoking without the flag at all, which is what this script
# does when MIN_TIP is unset or "none" — it builds the argument list itself
# rather than always passing `--min_amount`.
#
# The consequence of getting this wrong is silent: `--min_amount 0` is rejected
# by the contract with `InvalidAmount`, and leaving the flag out is the only
# way back to the "no floor" default.
