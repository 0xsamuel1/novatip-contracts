# Create a tip jar on a deployed tip_splitter contract.
#
# .env (repository root) is loaded automatically; exported variables win over
# it. The script works when started from any directory.
#
# Required env (see .env.example):
#   NETWORK, SOURCE, OWNER, SLUG
#   CONTRACT_ID  (optional; defaults to the contents of .contract-id)
#
# Recipients — either one of:
#   RECIPIENT  single-recipient shorthand; builds the 100% split for you
#   SPLITS     full splits JSON, e.g.
#              '[{"to":"G...A","bps":6000},{"to":"G...B","bps":4000}]'
#              bps values must sum to 10000; at most 20 recipients
#
# Usage:  ./scripts/create-jar.sh
#         SPLITS='[{"to":"G...A","bps":7000},{"to":"G...B","bps":3000}]' \
#           ./scripts/create-jar.sh
